#  diff bw for loop and while loop

#  for loop are used when there are range of value and while 
# loop are used when there is no range of values 
#  for loop are used when we know the number of iteration
#  while loop are used when we don't know the number of iteration
#  for loop are used when we need to iterate over a sequence
#  while loop are used when we need to iterate over a condition
#  for loop are used when we need to iterate over a collection
#  while loop are used when we need to iterate over a condition

# break is used to terminate the loop
# continue is used to skip the current iteration of the loop
